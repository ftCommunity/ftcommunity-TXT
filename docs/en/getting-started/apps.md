# Folder "System"

The folder "System" contains some useful apps which come with the CFW.

## About

This small app gives you the numbers of the current versions of the CFW and the libraries. It also provides you with the text of the required licences.

## Bluetooth

The CFW Bluetooth app lets you connect the TXT with the BT Control Set transmitter or a smartphone running the Bluetooth Control app.

## Display

With this app, you can rotate the display and calibrate the touchscreen, so that each touch signal is processed on the correct position of the display.

## FT-GUI

FT-GUI lets you access the original TXT GUI. This app needs to be running when RoboPro programs are started in the CFW system. Briefly pressing the ON/OFF button terminates the FT-GUI.

## Language

You can select your preferred language here. Some parts of the user interface have not been translated into the other languages. Please help the community and add missing translations.

## Network

Here you can enter network parameters such as IP-adress, netmask and gateway. As default, this is set to "automatic". In most cases, this is the easiest way to connect your TXT the internet. 

## Store

The store contains a number of interesting apps including tools for programming your TXT. The store needs internet access to connect to the server where the apps are hosted.

## WLAN

This app lets you select a WIFI and enter the key to access it.
