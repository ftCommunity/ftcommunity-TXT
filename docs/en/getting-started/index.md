# Getting Started

The community firmware runs from an SD card, so the first step is to prepare the SD card and set up 
the TXT to boot from SD card as explained in [installation](installation.md). After installation, the
community firmware can be accessed both via the [TXT touch screen](usage.md) and the 
[built-in web interface](usage.md#accessing-the-web-interface).

To revert back to the original firmware, simply shut down the TXT and remove the SD card.
