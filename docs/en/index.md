The **community firmware** is a free and modern operating system for your [**fischertechnik TXT**](http://www.fischertechnik.de/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-21/39_read-309/usetemplate-2_column_pano/). Heavily extended internet connectivity including an own app store as well as the ability to control and program models via PC, tablet or smart phone make your TXT fit for the future.

And best of all: You don't even have to open or modify your TXT for this because the **community firmware** is installed onto sd card and can that way be removed at any time.

# It's so simple!

You need:
* your [**fischertechnik TXT**](http://www.fischertechnik.de/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-21/39_read-309/usetemplate-2_column_pano/)
* a micro sd card with at least 2GB capacity

The installation happens in four simple steps:

1. Make sure that you are running at least [RoboPro Version 4.2.4](http://www.fischertechnik.de/ResourceImage.aspx?raid=10274)
1. Enable the bootloader of your TXT by following the [official fischertechnik instructions](http://www.fischertechnik.de/en/ResourceImage.aspx?raid=10279)
1. Copy the contents of the [community firmware ZIP archive](https://github.com/ftCommunity/ftcommunity-TXT/releases/download/v0.9.2/ftcommunity-txt-0.9.2.zip) onto your sd card
1. Insert the sd card into your TXT and switch it on!
