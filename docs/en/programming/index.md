# Programming

With the community firmware, you can program your Fischertechnik models in different ways, according to your preferences and programming knowledge.

* As a beginner, the easisest way is to use the graphical programming environment [Brickly](../../de/programming/brickly).

* An easy way to program directly on your TXT is the app [startIDE](../../de/programming/startide)

* Or you can write [Python](python) programs that use the ftrobopy library to access the I/O ports of your TXT

* And of course, [ROBOPro](../../de/programming/robopro.md) can be used as well, just as with the original firmware. Don't forget to start the app FT-GUI on your TXT zu enable the connection between ROBOPro and the TXT.
