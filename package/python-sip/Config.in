	  SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python
	  bindings for C and C++ libraries. It was originally
	  developed to create PyQt, the Python bindings for the Qt
	  toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for any C or C++
	  library.

	  SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module. The code
	  generator processes a set of specification files and
	  generates C or C++ code which is then compiled to create the
	  bindings extension module. The SIP Python module provides
	  support functions to the automatically generated code.
