	  Firmware Test Suite (FWTS) is a test suite that performs
	  sanity checks on firmware. It is intended to identify BIOS and
	  ACPI errors and if appropriate it will try to explain the
	  errors and give advice to help workaround or fix firmware
	  bugs.

	  dtc (libfdt) is an optional dependency for fdt related tests.
